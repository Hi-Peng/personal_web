Hello there! Thanks for comingðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site! I'm Hilal, undergraduate Electrical Engineering student from Yogyakarta State University. Mostly learn engineering outside class at **[Garuda UNY Team](https://garudauny.com/)** as **electrical engineer**. Interested to **electric mobility**, **power electronics**, **autonomous vehicles**, **robotics**, and **renewable energies**. Currently taking **Kampus Merdeka Internship Programme** at **Stechoq Robotika Indonesia** as **Hardware Engineer**.

In my spare time, I enjoy making music that no one will hear, doing sports (swimming and gymming), and travelling with family or friends.

I created this blog to share my thoughts, stories and imaginations.

Hope you can find something useful here. Feel free to contact me if you have something to discuss.
