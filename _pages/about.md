Hello there! Thanks for comingðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site! I'm Hilal, an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Yogyakarta State University. Mostly, I learn engineering outside of class at **[Garuda UNY Team](https://garudauny.com/)** as an **electrical engineer**. I'm Interested in **electric mobility**, **power electronics**, **autonomous vehicles**, **robotics**, and **renewable energy**. I am currently taking **Kampus Merdeka Internship Programme** at **Stechoq Robotika Indonesia** as a **Hardware Engineer**.

In my spare time, I enjoy making music that no one will hear, doing sports (swimming and gymming), and travelling with family or friends.

I hope you can find something useful here. Feel free to contact me if you have something to discuss.
